- Practice with MVC architecture
- Build RESTful APIs
- Learn deployment practices
- Work with databases and authentication

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Python / Flask (or Node.js / Express)
- **Database:** MySQL or SQLite
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
## M-  Team Roles
This section outlines the different roles in the AirBnB Clone project team, based on common responsibilities described in software development projects and inspired by the ITRexGroup blog.

🔹 Backend Developer
Responsible for building and maintaining the server-side logic, handling API endpoints, business logic, data processing, and ensuring that the system is secure and scalable.

🔹 Frontend Developer
Focuses on creating the user interface and ensuring a smooth user experience. They use web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React or Vue to make the application interactive and responsive.

🔹 Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs, manages, and optimizes the database. Ensures data integrity, backups, security, and performance tuning to support efficient data storage and retrieval.

🔹 DevOps Engineer
Handles CI/CD pipelines, deployment automation, and cloud infrastructure. Ensures the development environment is stable and helps with scaling and monitoring production systems.

🔹 UI/UX Designer
Designs intuitive, aesthetically pleasing user interfaces and experiences. Focuses on layout, color schemes, typography, and usability to ensure users can interact with the application efficiently.

🔹 Project Manager (PM)
Leads the planning and coordination of the project. Manages timelines, task distribution, team collaboration, and acts as the communication bridge between stakeholders and the development team.

🔹 Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
Tests the application for bugs, functionality, usability, and compatibility. Writes test cases and scenarios to ensure the product meets quality standards before deployment.

⚙️ Technology Stack
This project uses a modern and scalable set of technologies to build a full-featured web application.

🔹 Django
A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend logic, RESTful APIs, user authentication, and handle server-side rendering and routing.

🔹 PostgreSQL
A powerful open-source relational database system used to store and manage structured application data securely and efficiently.

🔹 GraphQL
A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, improving performance and flexibility compared to traditional REST APIs.

🔹 HTML5 & CSS3
Core web technologies used to structure and style the frontend user interface of the application.

🔹 JavaScript
A dynamic programming language used to enhance interactivity on the frontend and manage user events in real-time.

🔹 React (Optional)
A modern JavaScript library for building user interfaces using reusable components, making the frontend dynamic and responsive.

🔹 Git & GitHub
Version control tools used to manage source code history, collaboration, and deployment workflows.

🔹 Docker (Optional)
Used to containerize the application and its dependencies, enabling consistent development, testing, and deployment across environments.

🔹 RESTful API (within Django)
A method of communication between the frontend and backend using HTTP requests for accessing or modifying data resources.
