🧩 Feature Breakdown
This section outlines the core features implemented in the AirBnB Clone project. Each feature contributes to building a realistic and functional accommodation booking platform.

🔹 1. User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. The system supports both guests and hosts, ensuring secure authentication and role-based access to features.

🔹 2. Property Management
Hosts can list new properties, add descriptions, upload images, set pricing, and manage availability. This feature is essential to enable hosts to manage their rental offerings.

🔹 3. Booking System
Guests can view available listings, select dates, and make bookings. This module handles date validation, booking overlaps, and ties bookings to both users and properties.

🔹 4. Review & Rating System
Guests can leave reviews and rate their stays after bookings are completed. This builds trust and helps future users evaluate the quality of a property.

🔹 5. Payment Integration
Handles secure payment processing for confirmed bookings. Supports basic payment methods and stores transaction records for reference and future enhancements.
