⚙️ Technology Stack
This project uses a modern and scalable set of technologies to build a full-featured web application.

🔹 Django
A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend logic, RESTful APIs, user authentication, and handle server-side rendering and routing.

🔹 PostgreSQL
A powerful open-source relational database system used to store and manage structured application data securely and efficiently.

🔹 GraphQL
A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, improving performance and flexibility compared to traditional REST APIs.

🔹 HTML5 & CSS3
Core web technologies used to structure and style the frontend user interface of the application.

🔹 JavaScript
A dynamic programming language used to enhance interactivity on the frontend and manage user events in real-time.

🔹 React (Optional)
A modern JavaScript library for building user interfaces using reusable components, making the frontend dynamic and responsive.

🔹 Git & GitHub
Version control tools used to manage source code history, collaboration, and deployment workflows.

🔹 Docker (Optional)
Used to containerize the application and its dependencies, enabling consistent development, testing, and deployment across environments.

🔹 RESTful API (within Django)
A method of communication between the frontend and backend using HTTP requests for accessing or modifying data resources.

🗄️ Database Design
The database is designed to represent the core functionality of an AirBnB-like platform, with a focus on users, property listings, bookings, and payments.

🔹 1. Users
Field	Description
id	Primary key, unique identifier for each user
name	Full name of the user
email	Unique email address
password_hash	Encrypted password
user_type	Either guest or host

📌 Relationship: A user can list multiple properties (if host), and can make multiple bookings (if guest).

🔹 2. Properties
Field	Description
id	Primary key
title	Name or headline of the listing
description	Detailed description of the property
location	Address or city
price_per_night	Cost to stay per night
host_id	Foreign key referencing the Users table

📌 Relationship: A property is owned by one host (User), and can have many bookings and reviews.

🔹 3. Bookings
Field	Description
id	Primary key
user_id	Foreign key referencing Users (guest)
property_id	Foreign key referencing Properties
start_date	Start of the reservation
end_date	End of the reservation

📌 Relationship: A booking belongs to one user and one property.

🔹 4. Reviews
Field	Description
id	Primary key
user_id	Foreign key referencing Users
property_id	Foreign key referencing Properties
rating	Numeric rating (e.g. 1 to 5)
comment	Textual feedback

📌 Relationship: A user can leave multiple reviews, each review belongs to a property.

🔹 5. Payments
Field	Description
id	Primary key
booking_id	Foreign key referencing Bookings
amount	Total amount paid
payment_method	Credit Card, PayPal, etc.
payment_status	Pending, Completed, Failed
🧩 Feature Breakdown
This section outlines the core features implemented in the AirBnB Clone project. Each feature contributes to building a realistic and functional accommodation booking platform.

🔹 1. User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. The system supports both guests and hosts, ensuring secure authentication and role-based access to features.

🔹 2. Property Management
Hosts can list new properties, add descriptions, upload images, set pricing, and manage availability. This feature is essential to enable hosts to manage their rental offerings.

🔹 3. Booking System
Guests can view available listings, select dates, and make bookings. This module handles date validation, booking overlaps, and ties bookings to both users and properties.

🔹 4. Review & Rating System
Guests can leave reviews and rate their stays after bookings are completed. This builds trust and helps future users evaluate the quality of a property.

🔹 5. Payment Integration
Handles secure payment processing for confirmed bookings. Supports basic payment methods and stores transaction records for reference and future enhancements.

🔹 6. Admin Panel (Optional/Advanced)
An admin interface for managing users, listings, and reports. It allows for moderation of content and handling user issues more efficiently.

🔹 7. Responsive Design
Ensures the application is accessible and easy to use across various devices, including desktop, tablet, and mobile. Improves the overall user experience.

🔒 API Security
Securing the backend APIs is essential to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and maintain the integrity of the application. Below are the key security measures implemented in this project:

🔹 Authentication
We use secure methods (e.g., JWT tokens or session-based authentication) to verify the identity of users. This ensures that only registered users can access protected routes and services.

🔐 Importance: Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts and private operations like booking, reviewing, or modifying property data.

🔹 Authorization
Access control mechanisms are enforced to ensure users can only access resources they are allowed to. For example, only property owners can edit their own listings, and only guests can make bookings.

🔐 Importance: Protects sensitive resources by ensuring users don't access or modify data that doesn't belong to them.

🔹 Rate Limiting
Limits the number of requests a user or IP address can make in a given time frame to prevent brute-force attacks and abuse.

🔐 Importance: Helps prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and reduces server load from malicious traffic.

🔹 Input Validation & Sanitization
All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent common attacks like SQL Injection and Cross-site Scripting (XSS).

🔐 Importance: Ensures that only valid and safe data is processed by the server, reducing the risk of injection attacks.

🔹 HTTPS Enforcement
All data exchanged between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS to ensure secure data transmission.

🔐 Importance: Protects sensitive information such as login credentials and payment details from being intercepted.

🔹 Securing Payment APIs
Sensitive payment operations are handled securely through third-party providers (e.g., Stripe or PayPal) with tokenized payment data and secure callbacks.

🔐 Importance: Ensures that payment data is never exposed or stored insecurely, protecting both the user and the platform from fraud.
